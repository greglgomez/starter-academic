*New technology, Old human being*. The world seems to change faster everyday, yet us meatbags are a bit slower to adapt. I'm a UX designer fascinated by the interplay of our evolving technology and our diminishing capacity as individuals to understand it all. My path has led me to explore Permaculture as one of the answers to technology that doesn't destroy our forests or undermine our democracies, **Eco Social Tech** if you will.
